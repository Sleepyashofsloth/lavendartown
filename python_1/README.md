This is a read me file for my python project. It's not done yet but in the future I hope to make one!  This is how I made this read me,.

TextEdit (in Plain Text Mode):
Open Terminal.
Type touch README.md to create a new markdown file.
Then open it in TextEdit by typing open -a TextEdit README.md.
In TextEdit, make sure you're in plain text mode: go to Format > Make Plain Text.
Write your README contents and save the file.
